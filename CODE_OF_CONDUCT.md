# CODE OF CONDUCT

The idea is that we shouldn't have too many principles or rules. We are not trying to create a bureaucracy. Just the really necessary ones, the rest is more like advice or knowledge base. 

## Principles we try to follow

1. Be nice and respectful to others
2. Try to add value with your activity
3. Criticism is perfectly OK, but be constructive and respect points 1. and 2.
4. When trying to contribute follow the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) directives
