# Rye at a glance üåæ

Rye is homoiconic, code is just data.

```bash
data: { name "Jim" score 33 }
code: { print "Hello" +_ data/name }
if data/score > 25 code
; outputs: Hello Jim
```

Rye has no keywords or special forms. Ifs, Loops, even Function
definiton words are just functions (and you can define your own).

```bash
if-jim: fn { name code } { if name = "jim" code }

visitor: "jim"
if-jim visitor { print "Welcome in!" }
; prints: Welcome in!
```

Rye has more syntax types than your average language 
and it has generic methods for short function names, get and send
dispatch on the kind of first argument (http uri and an email address).

```bash
email: jim@example.com
content: html->text get http://www.example.com
send email "title" content
; sends email with contents of the webpage
```

Rye has a concept of op (operator) and pipe words. Every function can
be called as ordinary function or as op/pipe word 

```bash
http://www.example.com |get |html->text :content
jim@example.com .send "title" content
; sends email with contents of the webpage
```

## Examples and more info

A [blog](https://ryelang.blogspot.com/) following development.

The language [introduction documents](https://refaktor.github.io/rye/INTRO_1.html) are work in progress.

There is also a [simple website](https://refaktor.github.io/rye/) being made.

There is also a very small [FB group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/866313463771373) you can join.

## Platforms

Currently, tested on Linux, Mac and Docker.

### Builds the rye interpreter

```bash
go get -v github.com/pkg/profile \
  github.com/yhirose/go-peg \
  github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3
 
go build

# Executable
./rye 
```

### Builds the rye interpreter with all current builtins

You can leave just the tags and install just the bindings you want.

```bash
go get -v github.com/pkg/profile \
  github.com/yhirose/go-peg \
  github.com/labstack/echo/middleware \
  github.com/labstack/echo-contrib/session \
  github.com/gotk3/gotk3/gtk \
  github.com/lib/pq \
  github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3 \
  github.com/nats-io/nats.go \
  github.com/shirou/gopsutil/mem \
  github.com/tobgu/qframe

go build -tags "b_echo b_gtk b_psql b_nats b_psutil b_qframe" -o ryefull

# Executable
./ryefull 
```

## Docker image

The repository comes with [Docker image](./docker/Dockerfile) that is capable of building rye in its full, 
the final step however then just wraps executable so that the image remains small and nimble.

```bash
docker build -t refaktor/rye -f .docker/Dockerfile .
```

Run üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è the rye REPL with:

```bash
docker run -ti refaktor/rye
```

## OSX tips

Ryefull relies on GTK3. So make sure your machine has it.

```bash
brew install pkg-config gtk+3 adwaita-icon-theme
```
