# Benchmarking and tuning Rye compared to Python

## Loop 1+1 (builtins, arg collection)

add two numbers and assign them to a variable. In python it seems jou cant just do addition, as then the result is outputed.

x:: 1 + 1

## Loop x: 1 y: 2 (context setting of values)


## Loop to-upper (builtins, string allocation)


## Loop does (function calling, context allocation)


## Loop does x: 1 (function calling, context allocation, setting values)


## Loop fn (function calling, argument passing)
