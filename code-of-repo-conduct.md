# Code of repository conduct

With recent HN post a lot of new people came to follow development of Rye. We probably all want Rye updates and general state of Rye repository to 
be "a good product" to follow too. 

Here we try to come up with some directives, we could follow to achieve this. Everybody is are welcome to propose changes.

We shouldn't have too many principles (or rules), we are not trying to create a bureaucracy here. Just the really necessary ones, the rest is advice or knowledge base ... 

## Principles we really try to follow 

1. Main branch shouldn't be left in a failed state (the red cross)
2. PRs that are meant for merging should also pass all checks
3. Each new builtin should have a docstring written and at least few tests

## Q&A

How can I create commits / PR-s / merge them so that Github homepage feed is as informative as possible?
